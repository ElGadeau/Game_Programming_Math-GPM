# GPM
Static Math library containing Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Matrix3x3, Matrix4x4 and Quaternion
All you need to use this math library is to include "GPM/GPM.h", and link your project with the .lib file included.

Everything is within a namespace called GPM, you can even find a Tools namespace inside of it for Degree to Radian conversion, cosinus, sinus, square root and more. There is also a wrapping tool call Random for generating random numbers from the STL.
